Mastermind++

C++ implementation the mastermind board game.

Build by:

      ./bootstrap 
      make

Then run the game in game/.


OVERVIEW:

This is a small program which will make the computer play one round of
MasterMind against the command line user.

The game has a minimalistic main file in game/ whose primary purpose
it is to parse the command line options, if any, and start the game
itself. 

The game logic is all in a static library in src/. It consists of:

* mastermind.[h, cpp] - Main game file. Figures out whether the
  computer is the code breaker or if it is the user.

* gameboard.[h, cpp] - A class containing the actual game rules. This
  class is used no matter what role the computer has.

* code_breaker.[h, cpp] - Plays the role of code breaker. No attempt
  has been made to use Knuths algorithm. All computer guesses are
  purely random.

* code_maker.[h, cpp] - Plays the role of code maker.

The subdirectory cmdline/ contains a copy of my GitHub project
"argopt". This is used to parse command line options.


TODO: 

* Add nice GUI.
